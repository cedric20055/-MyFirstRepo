What I have learned from this course

So far in this Linux and version control course, I’ve learned how powerful **Git** is for managing code and collaborating effectively. Using Git on the Linux command line, I can **create branches**, make commits with meaningful messages, and **merge changes** without risking the stability of the main codebase. I also appreciate Git’s **distributed nature**, which lets me work offline and maintain full project history—including author, timestamp, and rationale for each change :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Learning to track changes, resolve merge conflicts, and revert to previous versions has given me confidence in safely experimenting with code. These skills have already begun to streamline my workflow and improve my confidence in software development.
